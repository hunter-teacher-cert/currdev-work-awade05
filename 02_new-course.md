## Computer Science Course
#### Description: <br>
AP Computer Science A is an introductory college-level computer science course. Students cultivate their understanding of coding through analyzing, writing, and testing code as they explore concepts like modularity, variables, and control structures.

#### Target Audience: <br>
The target audience for this course would be high 11th - 12th graders. This is an introductory college level course, therefore students should have some prior programming experience and be mature enough to handle the course work.

#### Where does it fit along with other courses at EWSA: <br>
I currently have a sequence of three courses at my school. I teach introductory CS all the way up to AP CSP. I am the only CS teacher at my school and I currently teach all three courses. Ideally this course would complete the four year sequence. Unfortunately I am unable to take on a fourth prep.
