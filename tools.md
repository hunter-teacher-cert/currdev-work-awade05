<h1> Technological Tools</h1>
<h2> Peblio</h1>
<p>Peblio is an interactive worksheet that provide a single document for your code, instructions, images, questions, and whatyever else to want to add to your lesson. Peblio provides an easier way to write about and teach code. Peblio pages are called PEBLS (pronounced pebbles) and they can include different media like text, videos, websites, questions, and code in different languages that can be written, and executed in our editor widgets.</p>
<p> I use peblio in my Intro to Computational Media course that uses p5.js.</p>
<p>Each lesson content, including Do Nows, Exit, videos and starter code are shared on this document. Students can make a copy of the document, edit any questions or prompts on the document. They can share their code in two ways, either share a link to the code or they can open a p5 ediotr directly within the document and code within the peblio document which saves theeir code automatically. Students then share their copy of the document with all the required components fulfilled in classroom.</p>
<p> I selected peblio because it allows me to share all my lesson content in one centralized location without having to share different documents and links to my students. </p>

<h2> Jamboard</h2>
<p>Jamboard is a collaborative online whiteboard. It gives students lots of creative work space. Jamboard is made for collaboration! You can also share your jams just like you'd share a document or slide presentation. </p>
<p> I use jamboards in all of my classes. </p>
  <p>I use jamboards for Do Nows, Exits or for students can brainstorm and create in small groups face to face on one device. You can Share an "everyone can edit" link with students in Google Classroom for whole-class collaboration. It is especailly helpful in remote or online settings, students can work together in small groups in the same jam.  </p>
  <p>I selected this tool for its collaboarative aspect, especially during the pandemic. Jamboard makes learning visible and accessible to all collaborators on the ‘jam session.’ You can also present your jams in real-time through Meet, allowing for screen sharing or making real-world connections. Jamboard also integrates with Google Classroom and obviously Google Drive, too.</p>
