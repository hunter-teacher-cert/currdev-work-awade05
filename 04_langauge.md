 <h1> Processing </h1>
 <p> This course would be a follow up to my Intro to Computational Media course that uses p5.js. The grade level for this course would be 10th - 11th grader with students having taken the p5.js course and would have had experience with programming.</p>
 <p>The language that this course uses builds on the Java language, but uses a simplified syntax and a graphics user interface. </p>
 <p> In order to write and run the code you will need to access the processing.org's website and download the install the software to your device and you should see the processing window show up on your device. You should now be able to run the Procesing Development Environment. There is a large area is the Text Editor, and there's a row of buttons across the top; this is the toolbar. Below the editor is the Message Area, and below that is the Console. The Message Area is used for one line messages, and the Console is used for more technical details.</p>
 <p>Although processing is based on Java, it is a straightforward language - easy to learn, understand and use, yet it is very powerful. There are no rigid rules or guidelines whatsoever to limit your creativity. It is based on Java and all your code gets preprocessed and converted directly into Java code when you hit the run button. Javaâ€™s PApplet class is the base class for all Processing sketches.  </p>
 <p>Strengths of processing apart from being easy to understand, is built with a library made for begginners in mind. It is used by thousands of visual designers, artists, and architects to create their works. Museums such as the Exploratorium in San Francisco use Processing to develop their exhibitions. It was created to make it easier to develop visually oriented applications with an emphasis on animation and providing users with instant feedback through interaction. Processing is free, open-source, and well-documented, which makes it highly accessible.</p>
 <p>I think that processing would be great for artists, designers, musicians and other creatives to explore, experiment, and develop their craft. Since it is built on Java it makes it easier to take the next step AP CSA.</p>
 <p> Processing is can create high end projects but is not great for game development and for larger size projects.</p>
 <p>Even though processing cannot complete huge projects and games, it can be used more for visual arts. Since processing is a layer on top of Java this can be a stepping stone that makes it easier to learn Java and create more complex projects.</p>
 <p>I chose this language for this class beacuse it makes and easy transition between what the students are already leaning in p5.js into Java.</p>
