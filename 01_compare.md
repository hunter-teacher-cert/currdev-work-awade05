 ### Compare the curriculum for a CS class you currently/will/have recently taught with a pre-packaged curriculum for the same course (or a course with similar focus).
 #### Code.orgs AP CSP & Project Stem's AP CSP
 ####  Major differences
 * Code.org uses their own platform APP Lab that uses javascript, while Project stem uses primarily scratch for their programming with one unit thrown in of python.
 * Code.org's platform allows you to choose between block or text based programming. Project Stem uses scratch which is block based with one unit of text.
 * Project Stem's platform is more self directed while Code.org is more teacher facilitated. 
 * Code.org for Units like the Internet and and Digital Information allow students to explore these new ideas and concepts with built in widgets to demonstrate how these    processes work while Project Stem relays the concepts through videos and slides.
 * Project Stems Unit exam are little more comprehensive and while Code.org does a brief overview of the Unit and puts more emphasis on the assessment of Unit projects.


 #### Major similiarities
 * Both courses have AP styled question embedded throughout the course after you have covered each lesson or concept.
 * Both platforms have built in Unit Assessment.
 * Both platforms allow for students to have a practice Create Task built into their curriculum.
 * Both allow for some portions to be auto graded.
 
 #### Comparative streangths & weaknesses 
 * I belive that both do a good job of covering the main ideas and concepts that must be covered for students to be successful on the exam. I do believe the Code.org has    the advantage of providing tons of material for the teacher to guide the lesson in a manner that fits their population of students while Project stem's curriculum        does not allow you to deter to much from the curriculum since it it built into the platform that students must follow. 
 
 #### Would you adopt anything from the curriculum you do not teach into your class if you could? Why?
 * I believe they both cover the Big Ideas that preapres the students for the AP exam. I really liked the Python but I don't know the place it had in the Curriculm after    they covered Scratch extensilvely. My guess is that it allowed you to better assess the code structures and psuedo code that is going to show up on the exam.
